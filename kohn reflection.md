# The Case Against Grades

Starting school was quite interesting. I grew up in a rural set in Kenya and children had to get to the age of five or six years to start school.
I therefore looked forward to starting school.At this time I knew how to read and write the alphabets, counting and of course my name, all these were taught me at home.
Starting school introduced something new to me, we began to be giveassignments and they were marked and grades given, consequently positions given. This therefore began to project school and exams a s a competition and a race for better grades.

Over the years so much as been written about grading: why it matters and why it is not very important in assessing whether one is learning or not. Most of these writings have been done by scholarswithout engaging the students to really undrrstand their views when it comes to grading in measuring their academic and learning progress. We should, I suggest involve the studentsin the whole process especially when it comes to deciding the method of assessing their progress in the whole learning process.

You see tests mainly come to test the retention capacity of the student and their ability to remember and reproduce the facts they have read or studied. So this just put to task only one or two parts of the students and mainly focuses on their memory.
Imagine a student who is ble to put to practice what they have learnt in a practical sense versus one who is only able to reproduce the knowledge on paper, who is a better learner?The former will be "condemned" and branded as a failure because they will not score the best of grades and the latter will be celebrated and branded the best, which is not the case as far as real life scenarios are concerned.Remember life and sucess in life to add is about solving problems for oneself and others.

# The Effects of Grading
Majority of the proponents of grading that are been championed nand used as evidence to the importance of grading are from studies conducted approximately one hundred years (De Zouche,1945; Linder,1940; Marshall,1968). All these show us why something diffrent needs to be done when it come to assessing the progress of students.
For instance, Kohn did a study to compare students who are led to focus on grades from elementary level to college versus those who are not
(Kohn 1999a,1999b,1999c)and he came up with the following conclusions:

## Grades make one to choose the easiest project
When students know that every project they are doing will eventually be graded they willl choose the easiest of tasks so as to score the possible highest grade. 
One will select a shorter book to read, easiest topic of research and the like. I remeber while doing my research project for undergraduate we had students who chose an easy topic so as to finish the project faster and have the best grade.In my case I did not really care about the grade, I wanted to do something that was of my greatest interest. The process was not easy but it was worth it and so fulfilling at the end of it.Becasue I did what I love and something that challenged my mind, I was able to seek help from the best professors and my project ebnded up as one of the best.

## Grades do not challenge one to think outside the box
There is a big diffrence between grading and learning. Grading just  causes one to focus on the course work - completing the syllabus.
Students only study what they need to know or expected to know because that is what will be tested. Going to my former example of the project in my undergraduate course,
I remember my project involved using tools that we had not studied in class, so I has=d to think outside the box on which tools to work with and that led me 
to learning new things. I still remeber those techniques to date whereas I may not remember the actual course content for most of my undergraduate courses.
This is also supported by Grolnick and Ryan (1987), who argue in a study of students concluded that students who focus on grading tend to forget the facts faster than those who don't.

In my case we should completely discard grading and focus on learning. Learning will not give pressure to students to take shortcuts in order to score the highest possible grade but rather increase their thinking capacity and imagination. However, further research needs to be done in this area. This process should involve all the stakeholdeers - students, instructors, emplyers, parents and even colleagues at work.
